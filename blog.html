<p>I haven’t posted any updates in a few days. I’m currently working on a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language">concatenative programming language</a> and it should be done within a week or two. It seems to be Turing-complete (I can implement functions like <code>map</code> and `filter), but I wouldn’t want to develop anything with it yet. It probably won’t be useful for practical purposes but it should be interesting.</p>
<p>At some point I’m going to move this website, or at least this blog, to an actual blogging platform. Right now I’m using a static site generator called <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, and I use Markdown to write the pages. It’s very fast, but not very powerful. I’m also taking an online course about web development, which will help me improve this website.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">10/2/13</h2>
<p>I’m currently developing a roguelike library in Scala. It’s currently quite usable, but there’s a few functions I need to implement before I can release it. If you want to try it already, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nstoddard/scala-console">it’s available on Bitbucket</a>. You’ll also need my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nstoddard/scala-common">Scala-common</a> library, which provides a bunch of utility functions and classes such as vectors, a configuration file reader, and the Mersenne Twister RNG. To use these libraries, run <code>sbt package</code> on the command line, go into <code>target/scala-2.10</code>, and copy the .jar to your project. To generate documentation, run <code>sbt doc</code> and open index.html in <code>target/scala-2.10/api</code>. When I release the library you’ll be able to download the jars directly and the documentation will be available online.</p>
<p>This console library differs from others in that it provides several varieties of console, such as hexagonal consoles, consoles that make it easy to display messages, and consoles that display tiles loaded from an image. Several of these consoles can be combined in one window.</p>
<p>The library is written in Scala, but it might also be usable in Java. However, it uses some Scala features such as partial functions that are hard to access from Java. If there’s demand for it, I might write a wrapper to make it easier to use from Java, but for now I’ll stick to Scala. In my opinion, Scala is significantly better than Java for most applications. For instance, you don’t have to declare the types of most variables (the compiler infers them), it supports operator overloading, and it’s great for functional programming. One other area where Scala is superior to Java is that it supports partial functions, which are functions written as a series of “case” statements. In this library, they allow you to handle input more concisely than you could in Java.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a simple program using this library, which displays an <code>@</code> sign that you can move around the screen (for people unfamiliar with roguelikes, the <code>@</code> sign is typically used to represent your character). There are several other examples in <code>src/Demo.scala</code>.</p>

      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The library is currently missing several features such as line of sight, field of view, partially transparent tiles, and integration with Swing. I’m not sure if all of them will be implemented before the first release.</p></div>
